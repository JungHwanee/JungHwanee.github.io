In the mid-summer of 2022, I joined <a href=”http://sites.google.com/view/battery-software/home” target=”_blank>BSL</a> (Battery Software Lab) at Korea Institute of Energy Technology (KENTECH) to conduct research in battery modeling. I collaborated with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=S6pQ6hQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Juhyun Song </a>. My research interests in Batteries focused on the battery modeling, particularly on Battery Material/Physics Modeling included harsh environments (e.g., fast charging), and Phase Transformation/Transition for Li-ion nano particle, as well as degradation model.

**Abstract:**

 Wide-spread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) requires batteries with fast-charging capability, high energy density, and affordable cost. Recently, to increase the energy density and reduce the production cost, large battery cells (> 10 Ahr) have been introduced regardless of form factors. For cylindrical cells that are increasingly popular in the EV market, however, larger cell size in diameter (e.g., 4680 cells) leads to slower heat dissipation and limits their fast-charging capability. In this talk, we present tubular form factor cells that can be cooled at the center. It replaces the central pole in cylindrical cells by a coaxial cooling channel that significantly enhances heat dissipation, and enables fast-charging without compromising the energy density and cost advantage of large cylindrical cells. 
    Figure 1 demonstrates enhanced cooling of tubular cells during fast-charging (6C CCCV) by comparing thermal behavior of a cylindrical (4680) and a tubular (4680-40; the latter two digits indicate the inner diameter) cell based on an electrochemical-thermal model. We will discuss reduction of charging time of tubular cells from that of cylindrical cells, and then effects of the cell design and the pack thermal management on the fast-charging capability of tubular cells.
